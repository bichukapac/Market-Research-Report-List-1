<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Microneedle Patch Transdermal Drug Delivery Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Solid Microneedles</li><li>Hollow Microneedles</li><li>Dissolving Microneedles</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Microneedle patch transdermal drug delivery systems include three primary types: solid microneedles, hollow microneedles, and dissolving microneedles. Solid microneedles penetrate the skin to facilitate drug absorption but require a separate liquid formulation for drug delivery. Hollow microneedles, on the other hand, have a channel through which liquid drugs can be delivered directly into the dermal layers. Dissolving microneedles contain the drug within the needle itself, which dissolves upon skin penetration, releasing the medication without leaving any waste.</p></p>
