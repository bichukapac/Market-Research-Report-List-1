<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hull Coatings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Self-Polishing Coatings (SPCs)</li><li>Fouling Release Coatings (FRC)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Hull coatings can be categorized into Self-Polishing Coatings (SPCs) and Fouling Release Coatings (FRC). SPCs gradually release biocides over time, reducing marine growth while providing a smooth surface as they erode, enhancing hydrodynamics. In contrast, FRCs utilize a slick, low-friction surface to prevent organisms from adhering, making removal easier without harmful chemicals. Both types aim to improve vessel performance and reduce maintenance costs, catering to the maritime industry's need for efficient and environmentally-friendly solutions.</p></p>
